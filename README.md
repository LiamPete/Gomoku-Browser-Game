# Gomoku-Browser-Game
The reason I decided to try and create a gomoku Board Game (Five in a row), is because all throughout highschool I played it everyday with my friends. I know I wanted to create old school games like tic tac toe, connect four, battleship, etc, but to create a game I've plyed for so long was really exciting for me.

The rules of Gomoku is pick a color (black or white). Black alwasy goes first, putting their piece on a tile, trying to achieve 5 in a row. Each player goes after one another to try and get five in a row first. Once a player achieves five in a row, a winning overlay will pop up displaying the victor for the round. To reset the board and play again just go ahead and click the text "Black or White Wins!". This will reset the board for endless fun!

Starting off I had an overall idea on how i needed to excute this, using my resources from class, multiple youtube videos on java, W3Schools, and ChatGPT.

This game may look simple but it defnifily wasn't the easiest for me. After finishing this project, I am excited to learn more and create way more games!
